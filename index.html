      <p>Here at Auburn Public Schools, we strive to help students both in and out of the classroom. We believe that one of the best ways 
        to help students is to give them the experience and skills they will need for the jobs they will hold in the future.Using this 
        site, local employers will be able to post job requests that they believe students will be suited for, and students will be able 
        to browse through and apply for those jobs.</p>
      
      <p>According to the University of Florida, the more you work during your first year of college, the more money you'll earn after
        graduation. By having a job in high school, we believe that our students will become better equipped to go down whatever path 
        they choose, whether that's joining the workforce, or starting their college journey. Having a job as a teen is proven to 
        time management skills and experience for later career paths. If a student expects to juggle working and schooling while in 
        college, we believe that it is an invaluable opportunity to begin developing these soft skills as early as possible!</p>

      <p>Auburn Public Schools has provided this website for the purpose of providing students an opportunity to discover local jobs
        and start adding to that resume right now! Employers may provide a brief description of their job to post open positions, and
        our students can navigate through these job postings in order to find the best fit for them.</p>
