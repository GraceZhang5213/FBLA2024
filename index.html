    <h2>District #29</h2>
    <p>Here at Auburn High School, we strive to help students both in and out of the classroom. 
      We believe that one of the best ways to help students is to give them the experience and skills they will need for the jobs they will hold in the future.
      Using this site, local employers will be able to post job requests that they believe students will be suited for, and students will be able to browse through and apply for those jobs.</p>
